# SUDOKU-SOLVER-AUTOMATION
Hello to anyone whoever visiting this!
In this I have code a simple python based project by importing some libraries.

HOW IT WORKS?
This is an actual application of DSA in small/basic project as it takes input from the user and solves the grid by grid in order.
For this project , I have used www.sudoku.com to take an input from these puzzles and to solve it.
You can check out the mp4 file in this repo as an live implementation of this project in working!
